### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Software Engineer with thorough understanding of designing, developing and maintaining web systems and mobile applications. I have a strong background in Javascript and solid grasp of Golang.

I can be easily absorbed by my work.

Presently focused on improving my skills and learning Golang, Docker, K8s and and improving my problem solving skills. Also I'd like to join and contribute to a team in an open and collaborative environment.
